    reflection: "This project showed me that designing a micro-interaction involves more than assigning an action to a gesture. The interaction needs to be understandable to the user, recognizable by the system, and reliable enough to feel intentional.\n\nOne of our biggest challenges was distinguishing deliberate navigation gestures from ordinary movements. Through feedback and iteration, we learned the importance of clear gesture mappings, useful system feedback, and testing interactions in realistic contexts.\n\nThe project also made me consider the accessibility potential of alternative input methods. Hands-free navigation could be useful for people who find traditional input devices difficult to use, as well as people whose hands are occupied during a task. At the same time, gestures are not universally interpreted in the same way, and gesture-based controls may create barriers for some users. Further research and testing with people with different access needs would be necessary to understand where this approach is genuinely helpful.\n\nIf I continued developing the project, I would improve gesture recognition and intentionality, make the gesture guide easier to read, expand recipe and navigation options, and test the experience with a wider range of users in realistic cooking scenarios.\n\nMy biggest takeaway was that successful interaction design depends on understanding people, communicating system behavior clearly, and refining ideas based on feedback. This project let me contribute to visual design, wireframing, documentation, presentation, and collaborative development while exploring how emerging technology can support everyday experiences.",
